## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
in this assignment, we had to make an LED blink red, and for the spicy part, we had to make the LED change colors.



```python
import time
import board
from rainbowio import colorwheel

if hasattr(board, "APA102_SCK"):
    import adafruit_dotstar

    led = adafruit_dotstar.DotStar(board.APA102_SCK, board.APA102_MOSI, 1)
else:
    import neopixel

    led = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)

led.brightness = 0.3

i = 0
while True:
    i = (i + 1) % 256  # run from 0 to 255
    led.fill(colorwheel(i))
    time.sleep(0.01)
    led.fill((0, 0, 0))
    time.sleep(0.05)

```
